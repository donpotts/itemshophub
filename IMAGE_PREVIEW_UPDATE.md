# Product Image Preview Enhancement - Complete âœ…

## Summary

Enhanced the ProductReviews application to display product images with proper placeholder handling throughout the system.

## âœ… Features Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Product List View (ListProduct.razor)**

**Card View:**
- Product images displayed with 200px height in card format
- Elegant placeholder with "No Image" icon when ImageUrl is empty
- Images use `object-fit: cover` for consistent aspect ratios
- Placeholder uses subtle gray background with centered icon

**Grid View:**
- 80x60px thumbnail images in grid cells
- Clickable thumbnails that open image dialog
- Consistent placeholder icons for missing images
- Clean, compact display that doesn't break grid layout

### 2. **Image Preview in Forms**

**Add Product (AddProduct.razor):**
